# Changelog

All notable changes to glia are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Shell conversation IDs used millisecond timestamps and could collide when two
  conversations were created within the same millisecond (surfaced as a flaky
  test on fast runners). IDs are now unique (timestamp + a short uuid).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-24

### Changed
- **Redesigned the desktop shell into a modern, multi-conversation app.**
  - **Conversation sidebar with persistent history** — conversations are saved as
    glia trajectory checkpoints (plain JSON) in the config dir, so history
    survives restarts; new/switch/delete from the sidebar. New endpoints:
    `GET /api/conversations`, `POST /api/conversations/{new,select,delete}`,
    `GET /api/messages`.
  - **Markdown + code rendering** for replies (bold, italics, lists, links,
    headings, and fenced code blocks with copy buttons), safely escaped.
  - A cleaner top bar, **example-prompt chips** on the empty state, a **slide-in
    glass-box drawer**, a **light/dark theme toggle**, and a refined settings
    panel with a segmented provider control. All previous behaviour preserved.
  - Updated the animated README hero to the new three-pane layout.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **OpenTelemetry exporter** (`glia.integrations.otel.OTelExporter`) — a hook
  that turns the event stream into spans: a root `glia.run` span with child
  `glia.model_call` and `glia.tool` spans (model/token/stop-reason attributes,
  tool errors marked; approvals and compaction as span events). Works with the
  real OTel API (`[otel]` extra) and is fully testable via a fake tracer; never
  raises into a run.

### Changed
- **Redesigned the desktop shell UI** — a warmer, cleaner palette, refined
  typography and spacing, softer message bubbles with entrance animations, a
  polished glass-box panel (colored event dots, pulsing live indicator), and a
  nicer composer. All existing behaviour preserved.
- **Animated hero** — the README/docs hero is now an animated SVG that plays the
  shell in action (streaming reply + glass box filling in), degrading gracefully
  to a full static frame where SVG animation isn't run.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Record/replay cassettes** (`glia.cassette`) — VCR for the `LLM` protocol.
  Record a real provider's responses to a readable JSON cassette once, then
  replay them deterministically with no network or API key.
  - `RecordingLLM` wraps a real provider and writes the cassette; `ReplayLLM`
    serves recorded responses, matching each request by key with an ordered
    fallback (`strict=True` requires exact matches). Streaming works both ways.
  - `use_cassette(path, provider_factory)` records if the cassette is missing
    and replays if it exists (VCR "once" semantics); `mode="record"`/`"replay"`
    force a direction.
  - Example `09_record_replay.py`; documented in the Guide (EN + RU).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **`OpenAILLM` provider** — OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Groq,
  Together, OpenRouter, local vLLM, …) via a `base_url`. Zero dependencies
  (stdlib HTTP), streaming + tool calling. glia now has four real providers.
- **Interactive approval in the desktop shell** — with the new "Ask before
  running each tool" setting, the shell shows an Approve/Deny prompt in the
  window and the run parks until you decide (resolved over a new `/api/approve`
  endpoint). Also adds **OpenAI** as a fourth shell provider mode.
- **MCP tool bridge** (`glia.integrations.mcp`) — use any Model Context Protocol
  server's tools as glia tools. Dependency-free adapter (`tools_from_mcp`) plus
  `mcp_stdio_tools` / `mcp_http_tools` connectors behind the `[mcp]` extra.
- A hero image (`docs/assets/hero.svg`) in the README and docs.

### Quality
- **mypy is now a CI gate** (`python -m mypy glia` runs in CI); fixed the few
  type issues it surfaced.
- Test suite grown to **151 offline tests, ~95% coverage** (adds OpenAI, MCP,
  interactive-approval, and shell-launch coverage). Fixed a race in `/api/quit`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **`OllamaLLM` provider** — run local open models (Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, …)
  via a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server. Free, offline, no API key.
  - **Zero dependencies:** talks to `/api/chat` over stdlib HTTP (`urllib`),
    with async streaming via a background reader thread.
  - Supports streaming and tool calling for models that offer it; maps glia
    messages/tool-results to Ollama's format and back.
  - Exported as `glia.providers.OllamaLLM` (eager import — no vendor SDK).
- **Ollama mode in the desktop shell** — a third provider option in Settings
  (host + model, with a datalist of common models), so the shell can drive a
  local model. New config fields `ollama_host` / `ollama_model`.
- Example `08_ollama_local.py`; Ollama documented in the Guide and Desktop app
  pages (EN + RU).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Desktop shell (`glia-shell`)** — a downloadable graphical chat app with a
  live glass-box event panel. It runs a real `glia.Agent` and streams every
  event (model calls, tool calls, approvals) to a self-contained single-page UI.
  - Pure-stdlib local server (`http.server` + Server-Sent Events); the only
    optional dependency is `pywebview` for the native window (`[shell]` extra),
    with an automatic browser fallback.
  - Works offline in demo mode (EchoLLM) out of the box; add an Anthropic API
    key in Settings — stored locally, never returned to the UI — for real Claude.
  - New console entry point `glia-shell` and `python -m glia.shell`.
  - CI workflow builds standalone Windows/macOS/Linux binaries and attaches them
    to each release.
- Docs: a "Desktop app" page (EN + RU).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-22

### Changed
- `_stringify` (tool-result rendering) now JSON-encodes only containers and uses
  `str()` for everything else — a plain object no longer comes back wrapped in
  quotes.

### Docs & tests
- Test suite expanded to **110 offline tests, ~98% coverage** (adds full offline
  coverage of the Claude adapter via a fake client, plus types, llm/echo,
  approval, structured, evals, memory, tools, and trajectory edge cases). CI now
  enforces a coverage floor.
- **Bilingual (EN/RU) documentation site** (MkDocs Material + i18n): home,
  getting started, guide, and architecture in English and Russian, with
  auto-deploy to GitHub Pages. Added `README.ru.md`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-22

Refinements that deepen the glass-box thesis. Every new capability is visible in
the event stream and off by default.

### Added
- **Streaming output.** `Agent(..., stream=True)` re-emits provider text deltas
  as `ModelDelta` events; the buffered `ModelResponse` still follows. New
  `StreamChunk` type and optional `StreamingLLM` protocol; both `ClaudeLLM`
  (via `messages.stream`) and `EchoLLM` (deterministic word chunks) implement
  it. Providers without streaming fall back to `generate` automatically.
- **Parallel tool execution.** A turn's tool calls run concurrently
  (`asyncio.gather`) by default (`parallel_tools=True`), with `ToolCalled` /
  `ToolReturned` events kept in the original call order.
- **Human-in-the-loop approval.** `approval=<policy>` gates every tool call
  behind an inspectable verdict (`ApprovalRequested` / `ApprovalResolved`
  events). Denied calls never execute and return an error result the model can
  react to. Built-in policies: `approve_all`, `deny_all`, `allow_only`, `deny`,
  and a reference interactive `prompt_in_terminal`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-22

Initial release. Proves the glass-box thesis end-to-end.

### Added
- Transparent agent loop: `Agent.run()` and `Agent.run_events()` with a full
  event stream (`RunStarted`, `ModelCall`, `ModelResponse`, `ToolCalled`,
  `ToolReturned`, `Compacted`, `RunFinished`).
- `@tool` decorator deriving JSON schemas from type hints (scalars, `Literal`,
  `Optional`/PEP 604 unions, `list`/`dict`, `Annotated` descriptions).
- `LLM` provider protocol with two adapters: `ClaudeLLM` (Anthropic SDK,
  optional dependency) and `EchoLLM` (deterministic, offline, for tests/CI).
- Serialisable `Trajectory` with checkpoint/resume (`glia.checkpoint`).
- Context engineering: `SummarizingCompactor` and `TrimmingCompactor`.
- Input/output guardrails (`glia.guardrails`).
- Provider-agnostic structured outputs (`generate_structured`).
- Subagents via `Agent.as_tool(...)`.
- Evals-as-tests harness (`glia.evals`).
- Zero-dependency core, `py.typed`, six runnable offline examples, 26 tests,
  green CI.
